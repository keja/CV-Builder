I started programming in 2003 (VB6) as a part of a school project and got hooked instantly. I care about web performance and a good user experience, i enjoy hunting for less ms in load performance and a fan of technologies based on non-blocking io. When im not writing code i enjoy playing hardball (paintball without paint), music and concerts. And just enjoying life with friends and cold beers."
